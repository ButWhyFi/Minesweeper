JavaFx is required to run this program.

Left click to uncover a square.
Right click to flag. 

The number in the top left keeps track of the number of flags required, and the icon next to it toggles on/off flag mode.
Flag mode lets you safely place and remove flags by left and right clicking. When you hover over the grid with flag mode active, the cursor will become an open hand.
